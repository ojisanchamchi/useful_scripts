This script (`av/botblock.sh`) is designed to block malicious bots from accessing your server. It leverages various techniques to identify and block unwanted traffic.

## When to use it

Use this script when you are experiencing:

*   High server load due to bot traffic.
*   Suspicious access attempts from unknown IPs.
*   Scraping activities on your website.

## How to use it

1.  **Review the script:** Before running, it's highly recommended to review the script's content to understand its actions and ensure it aligns with your server's configuration.
2.  **Execute the script:** You can run the script directly from your server's terminal:

    ```bash
    /path/to/useful_scripts/av/botblock.sh
    ```

3.  **Monitor logs:** After execution, monitor your server logs (e.g., Nginx, Apache, system logs) to verify that bots are being blocked as expected.

## Customization

The script might contain configurable variables at the beginning. You can modify these variables to tailor its behavior to your specific needs, such as:

*   **IP Blacklists:** Add or remove IP addresses from the blacklist.
*   **User-Agent patterns:** Define patterns to identify and block specific user agents.

Remember to always back up your server configuration before making significant changes.
